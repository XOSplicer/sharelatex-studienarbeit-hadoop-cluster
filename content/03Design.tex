\section{Analysis of Requirements}

\section{Research on Possibilities}

After the requirements are settled
the possibilities of how Hadoop can actually be installed 
on the given infrastructure will be researched.

There are four ways to install Hadoop that are considered here:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \emph{manual installation} of Hadoop 
        and every additional piece of software form the ecosystem
    \item \emph{\ac{CDH}} --  An open source software distribution by Cloudera including Hadoop
        and additional software from the ecosystem
    \item \emph{Ambari} -- An open source project by Apache that provides
        the capability to manage Hadoop Clusters and the software components running on it.
    \item \emph{\ac{HDP}} -- Hortonsworks distribution of Ambari
\end{itemize}
