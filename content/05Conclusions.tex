\section{Summary}

In the course of this paper the possibilities of an automated deployment of an Hadoop cluster in the environment of the \ac{DHBW} cluster computer have been examined.
The thematic setting of \ac{BIA} and \ac{BDA} within academia and business have been discussed to build a theoretical background for the paper. 
It has been concluded that the field of study around Big Data is still under active investigation and is gaining growing importance for many businesses.
Through its active engagement with many company partners in the \ac{IT} sector, the \ac{DHBW} Stuttgart has an active interest to incorporate these topics into their studies and lectures.

To support this general direction of development ... TODO

TODO

- explicit tasks derived
- alternatives for installation examined by hand-on experience
- one alternative is chosen
- cluster has been planned and exec plan is given
- plan was executed by doing steps: openstack, ansible dev + rollout, amabri cluster install, verification by quick test
- conclusion more or less functional because of resource sparseness and impractival allocations in openstack
- approch is in general proven to work

-( fill each with concrete statements aswell)
